# Card

Cards contain content and actions about a single subject.

Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic.

They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Elements, like text and images, should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

Basic card
Although cards can support multiple actions, UI controls, and an overflow menu, use restraint and remember that cards are entry points to more complex and detailed information.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Card">
    <Card sx={{ maxWidth: 300 }}>
      <Typography variant="caption" mb={4}>
        Word of the Day
      </Typography>
      <Typography className="bold" mb={4} variant="body1">
        rat &bull; chet
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle1" mb={4}>
        one who is dirty, low class, no moral values and place themselves in a
        situation of being known in a negative way.
      </Typography>
      <Divider />
      <Button variant="filled">learn more</Button>
    </Card>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

```jsx
<Card sx={{ maxWidth: 300 }}>
  <Typography variant="caption" mb={4}>

  <Typography className="bold" mb={4} variant="body1">
    rat &bull; chet
  </Typography>

# Paper

In Material Design, the physical properties of paper are translated to the screen.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Paper" parameters={{layout: 'fullscreen'}}>
    <Paper m={4} sx={{ maxWidth: 300 }} >
      <Typography variant="caption" mb={4}>
        Word of the Day
      </Typography>
      <Typography className="bold" mb={4} variant="body1">
        rat &bull; chet
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="subtitle1" mb={4}>
        one who is dirty, low class, no moral values and place themselves in a
        situation of being known in a negative way.
      </Typography>
      <Divider />
      <Button variant="filled">learn more</Button>
    </Paper>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

# App Bar

The App Bar displays information and actions relating to the current screen.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="App Bar" parameters={{layout: 'fullscreen'}}>
    <AppBar color="secondary" >
       <IconButton  color="secondary" ml={4}>
         <Hamburger />
       </IconButton>
    </AppBar>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

```jsx 
<AppBar color="secondary" >
    <IconButton  color="secondary" ml={4}>
